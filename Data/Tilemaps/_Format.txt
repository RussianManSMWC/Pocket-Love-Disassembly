The tilemap format is very straightforward:
dw [VRAM]
db [characters per row]
db [rows]

Then followed by rows of tiles

For example:
dw $9900
db 3
db 2
db "AAA"
db "BBB"

The above example will print two consecutive rows of tiles, consisting of "AAA" and "BBB", both are 3 characters long, from VRAM position $9900
