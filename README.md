# Pocket Love Disassembly
This is a disassembly of Pocket Love (ポケットラブ) - a Japan-exclusive dating sim for the Game Boy.

To compile the rom, you must obtain graphical data. You can use "ExtractPocketLoveGraphicsData" python script from "GFX Extractor" folder to extract it from the ROM, then move GFX folder to the main directory.

Additionally, you'll need to provide Nintendo Logo binary to make it work (hex $0104 through $0133).

To be assembled with RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System). This disassembly was made using version 1.0.0.
